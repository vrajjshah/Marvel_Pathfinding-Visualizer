# Marvel Pathfinding Visualizer
In my Marvel Algorithm Universe, Captain America has to meet Captain Marvel as soon as possible. But, the problem is Captain America has number of paths to reach Captain Marvel. Also, he has to deal with Hulk in between these paths. Captain America is asking Spider Man to find him the shortest path to reach Captain Marvel. But, one more problem is that Spider Man has to deal with Iron Man in between these paths. With all these above conditions, Spider Man has to find the shortest path for Captain America.

### Motivation
I like visualizations as much as I love algorithms. So, I tried to combine both and make this interesting project. As a Marvel fan, I have used Marvel characters for visualization.

### Algorithms
[Dijkstra's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm) : It is weigted algorithm and guarantees shortest path.

[Breadth First Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search) : It is unweigted algorithm and guarantees shortest path.

[Depth First Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search) : It is unweigted algorithm and does not guarantees shortest path.
